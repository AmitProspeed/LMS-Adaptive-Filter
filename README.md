# LMS-Adaptive-Filter
An Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) based on Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm to eliminate broadband noise from a narrowband signal


This project presents a modified method of random noise cancellation for removing noise using an adaptive line enhancer (ALE). The proposed ALE is implemented in time domain.

The basic adaptive filter structure chosen in this work is ALE based on Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm.
